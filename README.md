## New Mac Setup
I got tired of setting up my dev environments manually. So this is a WIP project to setup new boxes with my preferred configs.

## Credits
Started from this tutorial:
* https://freddiecarthy.com/blog/make-your-dotfiles-portable-with-git-and-a-simple-bash-script

With inspiration from:
* https://github.com/thomaspoignant/mac-dev-setup/blob/master/src/mac-dev-setup.sh
* https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup

And years of vim and bash lore from many legendary devs along the way...
