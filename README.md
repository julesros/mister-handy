## New Mac Setup
I got tired of setting up my dev environments manually.

So this is a WIP project to setup new boxes with my preferred configs.
## Install instructions
run:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -#fL raw.githubusercontent.com/julesros/mister-handy/main/install)"
```
## Additional Packages
* Install Docker Desktop
  * https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
## Credits
Started from this tutorial:
* https://freddiecarthy.com/blog/make-your-dotfiles-portable-with-git-and-a-simple-bash-script

With inspiration from:
* https://github.com/thomaspoignant/mac-dev-setup/blob/master/src/mac-dev-setup.sh
* https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup

And years of vim and bash lore from many legendary devs along the way...
